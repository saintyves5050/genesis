# Genesis | Words Creating Worlds

> *speak into the void and watch it take form*

## The Concept

In the beginning, there was chaos — thousands of particles drifting aimlessly through the void.

Then came **words**.

Genesis is an interactive experiment in creation. Type a word, and watch as the chaos *organizes itself* around your intention. Each word becomes a gravitational attractor, pulling particles into new patterns, new colors, new forms.

This is innovation as metaphor: **your words literally shape reality**.

## How It Works

1. **The Void** — 2,000+ particles drift in beautiful chaos
2. **The Word** — Type anything and press CREATE
3. **The Shaping** — Particles are drawn toward your word, taking on its essence
4. **The Accumulation** — Each word adds to the complexity; patterns emerge from combinations

## Word Semantics

Words carry meaning, and Genesis responds:

| Word Type | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Energy** (fire, sun, power, conquer, hope) | Warm colors, strong attraction |
| **Calm** (water, moon, peace, dream) | Cool colors, gentle pull |
| **Chaos** (storm, wild, explode, void) | Scattered colors, repulsion |
| **Growth** (tree, bloom, nature, seed) | Green hues, expanding influence |
| **Any other** | Unique signature derived from characters |

## Features

- 🌟 Real-time particle physics simulation
- 🎨 Semantic color mapping — words influence visual properties
- 🔊 Generative audio feedback (toggle on/off)
- ♾️ Infinite complexity through word combination
- 💫 Beautiful particle trails and decay
- 📱 Responsive design

## Philosophy

> "Go forth and conquer."

Creation is our nature. We don't just observe the universe — we shape it. Every thought, every word, every intention ripples outward and changes what exists.

Genesis is a meditation on that power.

## Try These Combinations

- `hope` + `fire` + `rise` — watch warmth build
- `chaos` + `peace` — opposing forces create complexity
- `conquer` + `dream` + `star` — ambition meets imagination
- Type your own name — see your signature in particles

## Technical

Pure HTML5 Canvas + JavaScript. No frameworks, no dependencies, no build process. Just math, physics, and intention.
